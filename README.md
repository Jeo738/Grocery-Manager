# Grocery Store Management System

Welcome to the Grocery Store Management System project! This application allows you to efficiently manage a grocery store by registering, deleting, and updating products, all while providing an intuitive dashboard for administrators to monitor the system's status and track product information.

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using a variety of cutting-edge technologies to provide a robust and user-friendly experience:

- **Spring Boot:** The backend of the application is powered by Spring Boot, which provides a solid foundation for building scalable and high-performance Java applications.

- **React:** The frontend of the application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **Next.js:** Next.js is used for server-side rendering and routing in the React application, enhancing its performance and SEO capabilities.

- **Docker:** The entire application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and manage across different environments.
